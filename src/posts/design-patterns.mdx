- High level description of solution

### Pattern

**Usually has**

1. Intent
2. Motivation
3. Structure
4. Code example

**Criticism of pattern**

1. Kludges for a weak programming language
2. Inefficient solutions
3. Unjust Use

### Types

1. **Creational patterns**
    
    Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    
2. **Structural patterns** 
    
    Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    
3. **Behavioral patterns** 
    
    Take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    

| **Creational Patterns** | **Structural Patterns** | **Behavioral Patterns**        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Factory Method          | Adapter                  | Iterator                        |
| Abstract Factory        | Bridge                   | Observer                        |
| Builder                 | Composite                | Strategy                        |
| Prototype               | Decorator                | Command                         |
| Singleton               | Facade                   | State                           |
|                         | Flyweight                | Template Method                 |
|                         | Proxy                    | Visitor                         |
|                         |                          | Mediator                        |
|                         |                          | Memento                         |
|                         |                          | Chain of Responsibility         |

## Creational Patterns

---

## Factory Method

Also called Visual Constructor

> The **Factory Method Design Pattern** is a **creational pattern** that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
> 

**Loose coupling** and **adheres to the Open/Closed Principle**

**Core Idea**:

Delegates object creation to subclasses via a factory method.

### Structure

![image.png](/DesignPattern/factoryMethod.png)

| **Role** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Interface for products | IProduct |
| Concrete Product | Actual implementations of product | ConcreteProductA, B |
| Creator | Declares FactoryMethod() | Creator (abstract class) |
| Concrete Creator | Implements FactoryMethod() to return product | ConcreteCreatorA, B |
| Client | Uses the Creator, not caring what it returns | Main() in Program |

### Applicability

1. If you don’t know before hand the exact types: Separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product
2. Way to extend internal Components.

```csharp
namespace CSharpPlayground.src.DesignPatterns.CreationalPattern;

public interface IProduct
{
    public void DoSomething();
}

public class ConcreteProductA : IProduct
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ConcreteProductA is doing something.");
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductB : IProduct
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ConcreteProductB is doing something.");
    }
}

public abstract class Creator
{
    // factory method
    public abstract IProduct GetProduct();

    public void PrintInfo()
    {
        IProduct product = GetProduct();
        product.DoSomething();
    }
}

public class ConcreateCreatorA : Creator
{
    public override IProduct GetProduct()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

public class FactorMethod
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Creator A = new ConcreateCreatorA();
        A.PrintInfo();
    }
}

```

## Abstract Factory

> **Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
> 


### Structure

![image.png](/DesignPattern/abstractFactory2.png)

### Code

```csharp
namespace CSharpPlayground.src.DesignPatterns.CreationalPattern;

#region Abstract Products
public interface IButton
{
    public void DoSomething();
}

public interface ICheckBox
{
    public void DoSomething();
}
#endregion

#region Concrete Product
public class WindowButton : IButton
{
    public void DoSomething() => Console.WriteLine("Window Button working");
}

public class MacButton : IButton
{
    public void DoSomething() => Console.WriteLine("Mac Button working");
}

public class WindowCheckBox : ICheckBox
{
    public void DoSomething() => Console.WriteLine("WindowCheckBox working");
}

public class MacCheckBox : ICheckBox
{
    public void DoSomething() => Console.WriteLine("MacCheckBox working");
}
#endregion

#region  Abstract Factory
public interface IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton GetButton();
    public ICheckBox GetCheckBox();
}
#endregion

#region  Concrete Factory
public class MacFactory : IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton GetButton() => new MacButton();

    public ICheckBox GetCheckBox() => new MacCheckBox();
}

public class WindowFactory : IGUIFactory
{
    public IButton GetButton() => new WindowButton();

    public ICheckBox GetCheckBox() => new WindowCheckBox();
}
#endregion

public class AbstractFactory
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        IGUIFactory factory = new MacFactory();
        var button = factory.GetButton();
        var checkBox = factory.GetCheckBox();

        button.DoSomething();
        checkBox.DoSomething();
    }
}

```

### **When to Use**

- When your code needs to **work with multiple families** of related objects (like Mac vs Windows UI).
- When you want to **decouple object creation** from the client logic.
- When you want to **ensure consistency** among related objects.

| Feature               | Factory Method                                      | Abstract Factory                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Creates a *single product*                          | Creates *families of related products*                     |
| **Abstraction Level** | Single factory method                               | Factory interface with multiple methods                    |
| **Creation Control**  | Subclass chooses what to create                     | Factory decides which product family to instantiate        |
| **Client Awareness**  | Knows product interface and creator                 | Knows only the abstract factory and product interfaces     |
| **Use Case**          | `CreatePizza(type)` in a pizza store                | `CreateButton()` + `CreateCheckbox()` for themed UI        |
| **Design Focus**      | Vary one product in a hierarchy                     | Ensure consistency across multiple related hierarchies     |
| **Output Example**    | One pizza (e.g., `CheesePizza`)                     | Coordinated widgets (e.g., `MacButton`, `MacCheckbox`)     |
| **Pattern Type**      | *Class-level* (inheritance – compile-time binding)  | *Object-level* (composition – runtime binding)             |
| **Flexibility**       | Less flexible; tied to one product line             | More flexible; supports multiple product families          |
| **Typical Classes**   | `Creator`, `Product`                                | `AbstractFactory`, `ProductFamily` interfaces              |

## Singleton Pattern

> **Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
> 

Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource—for example, a database or a file.

### Problem

1. **Ensure that a class has just a single instance**
2. **Provide a global access point to that instance**

### Solution

1. Make the default constructor **private**, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class.
2. Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.

### Structure

| **Component** | **Role** |
| --- | --- |
| private static Singleton _instance | Holds the single instance |
| private constructor | Prevents external instantiation |
| public static Singleton Instance | Global access point to the single instance |
| lock | Ensures thread safety |

### Code

> We use lock to make Singleton (or any shared resource access) **thread-safe** — because in a **multi-threaded environment**, if multiple threads access the singleton at the same time **before the instance is created**, it can lead to creation of two instances.
> 

> Using Locks
> 

```csharp
namespace CSharpPlayground.src.DesignPatterns.CreationalPattern;

// using Locks
public class Logger
{
    private static Logger? _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new();

    private Logger() { }

    public static Logger Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                _instance ??= new Logger();
                return _instance;
            }
        }
    }

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[LOG] {DateTime.Now}: {message}");
    }
}

public class SingletonDesign
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Logger _logger = Logger.Instance;
        _logger.Log("work")
    }
}

```

> Modern way using Lazy in C#
> 

```csharp
// Mordern way in C#
public class LoggerModern
{
    private static Lazy<LoggerModern> _instance = new(() => new LoggerModern());

    private LoggerModern() { }

    public static LoggerModern Instance => _instance.Value;

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[LOG] {DateTime.Now}: {message}");
    }
}

public class SingletonDesign
{
    public static void Run()
    {

        LoggerModern _logger2 = LoggerModern.Instance;
        _logger2.Log("code");
    }
}
```

### Quick Detour

### locks

lock statement in C# is used to **prevent multiple threads** from executing a block of code at the same time

```csharp
lock (someObject)
{
    // Critical section - only one thread can execute this at a time
}
```

- someObject is a **reference type** (usually private static readonly object _lock = new();)
- C# uses **Monitor.Enter and Monitor.Exit** under the hood.

### lazy

`Lazy<T>` is a .NET class that allows lazy initialization — meaning the object is not created until it’s first needed.

It’s also thread-safe by default.

```csharp
Lazy<Logger> _logger = new(() => new Logger());

Logger logger = _logger.Value; // Instantiates Logger only here
```

- Internally `Lazy<T>` uses a **delegate (Func)** to initialize the object.

---

## Builder Pattern

> The Builder Pattern is used to construct a complex object step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations.
> 

### **Problem It Solves**

Imagine you have a House class with 20 optional fields—garage, swimming pool, garden, number of floors, solar panels, etc.

If you use constructors or telescoping constructors like:

```csharp
new House(true, false, true, 2, true, false, ...);
```

### **Solution — Use Builder Pattern**

- Create a separate Builder class with methods to set optional fields.
- Finally, call Build() to get the constructed object.

### **Structure of Builder Pattern**

1. Product : The complex object being built
2. Builder Interface : Declares building steps
3. ConcreteBuilder : Implements the steps
4. Director (optional) : Orchestrates the build steps
5. Client : Uses builder to build the product

```csharp
namespace CSharpPlayground.src.DesignPatterns.CreationalPattern;

// Product
public class House
{
    public bool HasGarage { get; set; }
    public bool HasGarden { get; set; }
    public int Floors { get; set; }

    public override string ToString() =>
        $"House with {Floors} floor(s), "
        + $"{(HasGarage ? "Garage, " : "")}"
        + $"{(HasGarden ? "Garden" : "")}";
}

// Builder Interface
public interface IHouseBuilder
{
    IHouseBuilder BuildGarage(); // fluent interface : method chaining
    IHouseBuilder BuildGarden();
    IHouseBuilder SetFloors(int floors);
    House Build();
}

// Concrete Builder
public class ModernHouseBuilder : IHouseBuilder
{
    private House _house = new();

    public House Build() => _house;

    public IHouseBuilder BuildGarage()
    {
        _house.HasGarage = true;
        return this;
    }

    public IHouseBuilder BuildGarden()
    {
        _house.HasGarden = true;
        return this;
    }

    public IHouseBuilder SetFloors(int floors)
    {
        _house.Floors = floors;
        return this;
    }
}

// director
public class HouseDirector
{
    public House ConstructLuxuryHouse(IHouseBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.BuildGarage().BuildGarden().SetFloors(2).Build();
    }
}

public class BuilderPattern
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        var builder = new ModernHouseBuilder();
        var director = new HouseDirector();
        House house = director.ConstructLuxuryHouse(builder);
        Console.WriteLine(house);
    }
}
```

| **Feature** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Use Case** | Complex objects with many optional fields |
| **Fluent Interface** | Method chaining is often used (.BuildGarage().Build()) |
| **Thread Safe?** | Depends on implementation |

---

## Prototype Pattern

> Creates new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype), instead of creating from scratch.
> 

It’s especially useful when:

- Object creation is **expensive** (e.g., due to resource-heavy setup).
- You want to **avoid subclassing** just to copy objects.
- You want to **dynamically create objects at runtime**.

### Structure

1. Prototype Interface
2. Concrete Prototype
3. Client

### Code

```csharp
namespace CSharpPlayground.src.DesignPatterns.CreationalPattern;

public interface IPrototype<T>
{
    T Clone();
}

public class Person(string name, Address address) : IPrototype<Person>
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = name;
    public Address Address { get; set; } = address;

    public Person Clone()
    {
        return new Person(Name, new Address(Address.City));
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{Name} from {Address.City}";
    }
}

public class Address(string city)
{
    public string City = city;
}

public class Prototype
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        var person1 = new Person("John", new Address("New York"));
        var person2 = person1.Clone();
        person2.Name = "Jane";
        person2.Address.City = "Boston";

        Console.WriteLine(person1);
        Console.WriteLine(person2);
    }
}

```

---

### Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

```csharp
// Shallow Copy
var person1 = new Person { Name = "John", Address = new Address { City = "NY" } };
var person2 = person1.MemberwiseClone() as Person;

person2.Name = "Jane";
person2.Address.City = "Boston";

Console.WriteLine(person1.Name);         // John ✅ (different string)
Console.WriteLine(person1.Address.City); // Boston ❌ (shared Address)

// Deep Copy
var person2 = new Person
{
    Name = person1.Name,
    Address = new Address { City = person1.Address.City } // new Address
};

person2.Name = "Jane";
person2.Address.City = "Boston";

Console.WriteLine(person1.Name);         // John ✅
Console.WriteLine(person1.Address.City); // NY ✅
```

| **Feature** | **Shallow Copy** | **Deep Copy** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Top-level object** | ✔️ New instance | ✔️ New instance |
| **Nested objects** | ❌ Shared references (same objects) | ✔️ New instances of nested objects |
| **Copying method** | MemberwiseClone() | Manual copy or serialization |
